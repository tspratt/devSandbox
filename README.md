Jungle requirements:

* The jungle contains several species of animals; tigers, monkeys and snakes.
* All animals can do three things, make a sound, eat food, and sleep.
* Each species of animal knows how many others of its kind exist.
* By default when an animal’s energy level changes, it changes in the following ways:
* -3 for making a sound
 * +5 for eating food
 * +10 for sleeping
* The jungle can perform a sound off. This involves all of the animals in the jungle each making their sound, along with reporting their energy level.
* Tigers get +5 energy for sleeping.
* Monkeys get +2 energy for eating and -4 energy for making a sound.
* Some animals have the ability to play.
 * Only monkeys can play. When they do they say "Oooo Oooo Oooo" and get -8 energy. If a monkey doesn't have enough energy to play they say "Monkey is too tired".
* The jungle contains several types of food; meat, fish, bugs and grain.
 * Tigers can't eat grain because they have sensitive digestive systems.
* Bonus Item: The jungle can have each animal perform a random activity out of the ones possible for that animal.
